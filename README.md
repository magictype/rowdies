The action hero that stands out from the crowd. Typically belongs to a financially poor family background. Or maybe no background. “Being Rowdy is not just about being rough and tough. Firstly its to do with the fantasy of staying strong. It's my way of sophistication, probably overrated by myself. Being bold. Bold to be confident and fearless. To not easily get intimidated. And to stay resilient. I definitely don't mean to be rude or disrespectful to anyone. Every time I sense a glamour in me, I totally enjoy it. ” Rowdy says.
